            CSS grid layout or CSS grid is a technique in CSS 
            that allows web developers to create complex 
            responsive web design layouts more easily and 
            consistently across browsers.[1] There have 
            been other webpage layout methods used previously 
            including tables, the box model, and CSS flex box. 
            It is currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation despite 
            already being adopted by most major browsers.
